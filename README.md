See my [personal website here](http://aibhleog.github.io)! I use an [HTML5UP](html5up.net) template whose HTML 
and CSS I've heavily edited.  

For anyone looking to find amazing phone/tablet/computer-compatible templates that are clean and well-designed (and also allow you to tweak every little thing), check out [HTML5UP](html5up.net).  [@ajlkn](http://twitter.com/ajlkn), the creator of these sites, is wonderfully talented and has provided these resources for FREE.
