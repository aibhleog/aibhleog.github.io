									<p>I'm currently a NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP) Fellow working at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center with Dr. Jane Rigby.  I was hired under the JWST-specific call for the NPP, so I get to work on <i>just</i> JWST data &mdash; both as part of the big collaborations I'm in and as a collaborator on various awarded Cycle 1 programs.  The data are amazing, yall. </p>

									</header>
									<p>I received the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship in Spring 2018. The application process the previous fall had been a stressful but rewarding experience. When I first expressed interest in applying, I was told by some faculty to not even bother &ndash; that only Ivy Leagues & West Coast R1 institutions ever got it.  Thankfully I'm very stubborn and had a very supportive advisor (thanks, Casey Papovich!) so I did it anyway.</p>
									
									<p>I've written up some of my personal experience &amp; advice for this process, as well as sharing my application statements and linking a ton of past &amp; current NSF Fellows whose resources I leaned on heavily.

										<h3><strong><font color="#589FCE"><a href="https://uniquescientists.weebly.com">#UniqueScientists</a></font></strong> Editing Director</h3>
									</header>
									<p>I am the Editing Director for an international team running the <a href="https://uniquescientists.weebly.com"><strong><font color="#589FCE">#UniqueScientists</font></strong></a> project.  This project was first conceived when a friend faced archaic prejudices for what a scientist <i>should</i> look like and decided to change that. The goal of #UniqueScientists is to normalize and celebrate how diverse and unique every single scientist is &mdash; in the hopes that 1) every day those with prejudices find a less and less welcoming place for their archaic and hateful words, and 2) everyone can find a scientist that looks like them and feel that anything is possible.</p>
									
									<p>We are currently on a hiatus, but we hope to revamp soon!</p>
