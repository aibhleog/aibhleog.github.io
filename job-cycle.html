								<p>As someone who just went through her first job cycle... oof.  I definitely benefitted from having colleagues and friends help me figure things out, sharing tips and tricks, and pointing me towards resources.  Throughout my job cycle, I wrote down all of it (and other things I figured out) in the hopes that this information can be helpful for those who come after me.
								</br></br>
								<font color="#F4D03F">If you're just now approaching your first job cycle, congrats!</font>  That's a big milestone in your career, and you absolutely deserve to be here.  Hopefully this massive list of tips, tricks, and resources will help make this process less completely unknown and overwhelming for you.
								</br></br>
								Thank you to the many wonderful people who looked over this page and provided feedback, more items/resources to add, etc.:  [name 1], [name 2], ....

											<!-- personal branding / professional development -->
											<button class="accordion">personal branding</button>
											<div class="panel">
												<p>
													First, I want to share my personal philosophy about personal branding and professional development.  Namely, that personal branding is often under-appreciated and is actually incredibly valuable and a powerful tool.  This can manifest in different ways -- for example, if you create a username for yourself that is very unique, fairly easy to spell, and representative of you in some way, chances are that username will be available on every platform you have.  At that point, you can make everything (email, twitter, instagram, Linkedin, GitHub) have the same username, and networking will become that much easier. 
													</br></br>
													Another part of this is cultivating your resources: such as your CV, your website (if you don't have one, continue reading), your GitHub (if you don't have one, continue reading), your Linkedin, and anything else that you may use.  The more frequently you spend time updating and aesthetically organizing these resources, the more complete your professional profile becomes.  Doing this quickly develops into an impressive profile of resources that show that you are intentional about your professional development. 
													</br></br>
													The best part about this is that if you keep up with all of this, doing a little bit of work on it here and there, it naturally grows more and more with little effort from you at any given time.  Compare this technique to the amount of time and stress required if you tried to create a CV from scratch right before your first job app -- chaos.  <i>Putting in the time now and intentionally thinking about this will pay off, I promise.</i>
												</p>
												
												
												<p>
													<strong><font color="#589FCE">GITHUB</font></strong> &mdash; as the modern astronomer frequently moonlights as a computer scientist, online websites like GitHub (that can house software development and implement version control using Git) are fantastic resources to use and develop.  In job &amp; fellowship applications, cultivating your GitHub and linking it to your apps/CV/etc. is a great idea.  Below I'll specify a few ways I have personalized my GitHub, in case it helps you think through how to work on yours.
												</p>
												<ul><ul class="alt"> <!-- mention how you can turn on private repo tracker -->
													<li></li>
													<li>
														<strong>Be intentional about your username.</strong>
														When you're making your GitHub for the first time or when you're thinking about how to revamp your account, think carefully about what you want your username to be.  Ideally, you should pick a name that is unique to you (also, in my opinion, preferably without a list of numbers at the end, ex: taylor2798) and easy enough to remember or spell.  
														</br></br>
														For example, if your name is available by all means take that, but try not to let your username be too many characters either.  When I made my account,  my name (in every variation) was taken already.  So I used the word "aibhleog" because it was already my grad school email and it's a Gaelic word that no one else would use.
														</br></br>
														One of the major advantages to picking a good username for GitHub is that you can host your website from GitHub, which ends up being [your-username].github.io -- so as you can see, being intentional with your username is a great idea.
													</li>
													<li>
														<strong>Add a GitHub bio to your GitHub Profile.</strong>
														This is a relatively new feature (c. 2020, I think) that allows you to create a README that appears on your profile, kind of like a bio.  It's super easy to set up and there are lots of great examples on how to customize it to be exactly like you want.  Also -- along the same lines as before -- this is a GREAT way to build up that professional overall profile that I mentioned before.
														</br></br>
														Below are some links that can help you get more familiar with how to make and customize your own.

													<strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; MAKE A PERSONAL ADS LIBRARY</font></strong> &mdash; This was some great advice I got from my friend <a href='https://emily-c-martin.com' target='_blank'>Dr. Emily Martin</a>.  By making a personal ADS library with every paper you have led or been a co-author on, you can link this on your CV, website, etc.  Also, you can export your citations to a table of authors and affiliations (helpful when a job asks for a publication list). 
													<!-- button -->
													</br></br><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/JwoiXzYoSdikDW8g9haG2g" class="button primary" target="_blank">my public ads library</a>
													<dl><dd>How to do this:  </br>
													First, make a personal ADS library on your ADS account, name the library with your name &ndash; for example, mine is <strong>Taylor A. Hutchison</strong>.  Make sure that the library is public -- you can do this by navigating to the "Manage Access" tab on the library.   Finally, take the "public address" link they provide for the library (NOT your URL) and use that wherever you want to link your library.</dd></dl>
												</p>
													
												<!-- link orcid to ads -->
												<p><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; Link your ORCID to your ADS</font></strong>, then you can add your papers to your ORCID through an official channel.  Additionally, be sure to update your employment and your education on your ORCID profile, as well as adding keywords and linking your website and your GitHub.</p>
													
												<!-- exporting ads -->
												<p><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; EXPORTING CITATIONS VIA ADS</font></strong>, using custom formatting.  Let's pretend that you've made an ADS library for your NSF AAPF application.  You want to export all of your citations at once, but the NSF requires that every single author on every single paper is listed (silly, yes I know).  With ADS, you can do this in seconds! 
												<ol><ol>
													<li>Check the boxes next to the citations you want to export (or check the box that marks all of them). </li>
													<li>Click to the tab in the library that says "Export", it should drop down a list of options (like BibTex, AASTex, etc).  </li>
													<li>Click on "Other Formats", which will take you to a new page with a drop down box.  </li>
													<li>Click on the box and choose the last entry ("custom format").  A blank box should appear below the drop down box.</li>
													<li>In this empty box, copy and paste the first line of the code I share below (don't include the "// NSF AAPF" part) into that entry box and press "Apply.</li>
												</ol></ol>
<pre><code>// NSF AAPF
%l (%Y), %J, %V, %p.\n 

// NPP (separate bib)
%3.2a (%Y), %T, %J, %V, %p.\n

// NPP (in statement)
%3.1m (%Y), %j, %V, %p $\bullet$</pre></code>

													Congrats!  You have a complete list of all of your references in the correct format, with every single author on every single paper listed.  You can now export this list by copy and pasting into a document, or by clicking "Download to File".  </br></br>
													For completeness, I also listed examples for what I used for my NPP application, too.  You should also check out ADS's help page for this feature (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/actions/export">linked here</a>) and explore all of your options.  ALSO BE SURE TO CHECK THE SOLICIATION REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUR JOB APPS WHEN EXPORTING CITATIONS.

												<!-- adding pdfs in latex -->
												<p><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; adding pdfs together when an app requires it?</font></strong>  either do them all in the same doc OR you can combine the separate PDFs by doing 
	<pre><code>\usepackage{pdfpages}
	
% right before \end{document}
\newpage
\includepdf[pages=-]{cv.pdf}</pre></code>

															<p>Early on into the job cycle, I was looking through the jobs and fellowship that had already posted, marking the ones I was interested in, wondering how I would keep track of everything.  Serentipetiously, at that moment my friend Jackie Champagne shared this amazingly detailed spreadsheet that she had made to track all of the fellowships that were in our field.  Taking that spreadsheet, I modified it to work for both postdoc jobs and fellowships and used it as my centralized job tracker.</p>
															<p>I've made a template version of my spreadsheet job tracker, which is linked below.  In the spreadsheet, there are three tabs so you can see how the document changes as you apply for things and begin hearing back from places.  Also, I've added a lot of comments with additional information, so hover over the cells with the gold corners to see what comments I've left.

														<div class="panel">
															<p>When applying for fellowships, it's a great idea to ask current and/or past fellows if they are comfortable sharing their applications that they submitted for the fellowship.  Seeing successful examples of a fellowship application can be really helpful when crafting your own.  I sent a ton of emails like this at the beginning of the job cycle.</p>
															<p>Sometimes, I was just asking if they'd be comfortable sharing their app; other times, I asked if they'd have time to meet and talk about what it's like to be a fellow and how they accomplished the things they proposed for.  The latter was especially something I was interested in for fellowships like the NSF AAPF, where they have you propose for not only your science but also a "broader impacts" program.</p>
															<p>I'm eternally grateful to every person who replied and shared their application materials with me.  In the same spirit, I've generalized my emails that I sent and turned them into templates which you are welcome to use if you find them helpful!

This tracker is a heavily modified version of one shared with me by a postdoc friend (& mentor) of mine.  In this tracker, I included details such as the job/fellowship name, link to the job ad, who to address the letters to, when the deadlines where, and a checkbox for the letter writer to mark once they submitted a letter.  This helped both of us make sure that we were always on the same page.

												<h3>general job interviews tips</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
												<li>be honest about what you don't know, but make sure that's not all you talk about
												-- seems like they like to know that you're being honest, tha tyou have a more humble opinion of yourself
												-- but there's probably a threshold, like "oh you dont' know enough"</li>
												<li>if they wont take a chance on your</li>
												<li>women disproportionately dont' apply for jobs compared to men when they feel they dont match it to a T</li>
												<li>share your skillsets, and things that you don't know but express that you're really willing to learn</li>
												<li>what is the company like? 
												company culture?
												what are we working on?  like what am I getting myself into?
												-- make sure you understand it</li>
												<li>what does the place you're interviewing at value?</li>
												</ul>


												<h3>from colleagues:</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
												<li>Like [redacted] mentioned above, one piece of advice I’ve found useful was also to prepare a list of questions (both “harmless filler”  questions and “serious” questions) that you can put out. Unless you know the interviewers well, in the end, the chats can get a bit silent sometimes, and some interviewers are not chatty (I am also a natural introvert myself). So it’s useful to have a list of “harmless” questions that you can turn to, to keep the conversations going (like what kind of computing/observing resources do the students/postdocs use at your institution), as well as “real” questions that shows that you are giving serious thoughts to the position.

												If you know who’d be interviewing you, it’s sometimes helpful to look up their research profiles (don’t overdo it though). Sometimes it’s useful to mention “Oh I noticed that you wrote this paper  (and that paper could be totally irrelevant to the interview)” — that could really get people talking (and show that you are serious at the same time).</li>

												<li>[redacted]'s biggest piece of advice to me was basically "30 minutes isn't enough time to really move the needle, you just want to do no harm"
												another useful thing he said was to make sure you come in with a list of questions to ask them. makes it obvious that you've considered this place and are actually interested. I can give you examples

												from me, make sure you understand the format going in. things like who will be interviewing you, should you prepare slides or just have a quick spiel about your future research, etc are fair game to ask beforehand</li>
												</ul>



												<h3>from hiring perspective</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
												<li>curiousity is something to look for</li>
												<li>are you thoughtful about the role</li>
												<li>what the team is there for</li>
												<li>are you excited by the prupose of the org?</li>
												<li>does it tie to your career goals?</li>
												<li>candidates that ask good qs stand out</li>

												<li>process-oriented (for [redacted]'s job)</li>
												<li>humility (confidence too of course)
												-- but you're not working in isolation</li>
												<li>"bias for action"
												-- are you able to make decisions do them with confidence</li>

												<h3>motivational tips</h3>
													</p>Create a TO-DONE list where you can write and cross out things that you're doing -- even if they're small things, you should add them.  It all builds up.
													</br></br>
													Here's an example of mine.  I use Trello for a variety of things, but I especially love it because I have this "card" and I just keep adding to the check list and then immediately check the items off -- it's super sastifying and very encouraging.
