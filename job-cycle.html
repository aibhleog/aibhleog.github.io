								<p>As someone who just went through her first job cycle... oof.  I definitely benefitted from having colleagues and friends help me figure things out, sharing tips and tricks, and pointing me towards resources.  Throughout my job cycle, I wrote down all of it (and other things I figured out) in the hopes that this information can be helpful for those who come after me.
								</br></br>
								<font color="#F4D03F">If you're just now approaching your first job cycle, congrats!</font>  That's a big milestone in your career, and you absolutely deserve to be here.  Hopefully this massive list of tips, tricks, and resources will help make this process less completely unknown and overwhelming for you.
								</br></br>
								Thank you to the many wonderful people who looked over this page and/or provided feedback, more items/resources to add, etc. &mdash;  Dr. Stephanie Ho, Dr. Jackie Champagne, Dr. Jasleen Matharu, Dr. Emily Martin, Dr. Jonathan Cohn, Dr. Alex Riley, Dr. Steven Finkelstein, Dr. Yuanyuan Zhang, [name 1], [name 2], ....

												<p>
													<strong><font color="#EBA28A">READ THE JOB SOLICITATIONS FULLY</font></strong> &mdash; Take note of any formatting requirements, any page limits or word limits, anything they specifically want you to mention.  For fellowships, especially, pay attention to anything they DON'T want (for example, the NSF AAPF now requires that apps focus <50% on NASA-supported data).  <font color="#EBA28A">Do everything the solicitations specify so that your app isn't immediately thrown out.</font>
												</p>
												<p>
													<strong><font color="#589FCE">Establish clear expectations with your advisor</font></strong> &mdash; The job cycle is going to be a very chaotic and time-intensive thing.  So it's a good idea to plan ahead for everyone involved.  Ask your advisor if they will have time to read your statements, or if they want them in advance (and if so, how far in advance).  Tie this into your working style and planning.
													</br></br>
													For the most part, you may find that you use the same job statement over and over, albeit modified to fit the science goals and data access for each institution you apply to.  So, in light of that, part of your conversation with your advisor could be getting feedback on your first job app and then possibly some discussion on ways you plan to change that statement/proposed science to fit the other jobs &amp; fellowships you'll be applying for.

													<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">JOB TALK TOUR: giving talks at institutions</font></strong> &mdash; as part of the job cycle (and in the semester &amp; summer prior to it) it's a great idea to reach out to institutions that you plan on applying to and ask if they have a seminar series that you could be signed up for.  Also reach out to any colleagues or contacts that you have to ask about this, too, and ask your advisor for names and suggestions as well.
													</br></br>
													Giving a talk tour is not only a great way to network with people at places that you may want to work at, it's also great practice -- always keep up your talk-giving skills because it's a huge part of your professional development and how you advertise yourself and your science.
													</br></br>
													<strong>TIPS:</strong>													
													<ul>
														<li>HAVE A 20 MIN AND 1 HR VERSION OF YOUR TALKS PREPARED. This advice comes from experience -- I gave enough job talks that I had talks of both lengths already, thankfully.  This came in use one day when, right before I joined a zoom call where I was going to give another talk, I realized that the organizers had never communicated how long they wanted my talk to be... I had prepared for the 1hr version, but when I joined the call they said 20min.  So always be prepared!</li>
														<li>When you visit a place to give a talk, make sure to look up who works there beforehand and identify people you know or that you'd like to meet.  Ask to meet with these people after your talk (hopefully during the same day as your visit or afterwards via zoom or something).  Use this as a chance to network!</li>
														<li>When applicable, during your visits at institutions, you can also ask to meet with people there who have held fellowships that you're planning to apply for. Ask them for advice on how to apply as well as asking if they'd be comfortable sharing their fellowship application material.  But also be sure to talk to them about their science, too.</li>
													</ul></li>
													
													<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">UPDATE YOUR CV; have different length versions</font></strong> &mdash; always try to keep your CV as up-to-date as possible.  This is just in general a great thing to do, but it also makes your life much easier when it comes to the job cycle.  I wax poetic about this and other professional development things in the <strong>"Personal Branding"</strong> section, so I'll spare you from that here.
													</br></br>
													What I WILL say is this:  not only should you keep your CV updated, you should have a 1-2 page version at the ready, too.  In my experience, most jobs didn't care how long your CV was, however some <it>definitely</it> did.  For example, one of my job apps required that my CV be 2 pages max -- prepping this early is a great idea.

												<p>
													First, I want to share my personal philosophy about personal branding and professional development.  Namely, that personal branding is often under-appreciated and is actually incredibly valuable and a powerful tool.  This can manifest in different ways -- for example, if you create a username for yourself that is very unique, fairly easy to spell, and representative of you in some way, chances are that username will be available on every platform you have.  At that point, you can make everything (email, twitter, instagram, Linkedin, GitHub) have the same username, and networking will become that much easier. 
													</br></br>
													Another part of this is cultivating your resources: such as your CV, your website (if you don't have one, continue reading), your GitHub (if you don't have one, continue reading), your Linkedin, and anything else that you may use.  The more frequently you spend time updating and aesthetically organizing these resources, the more complete your professional profile becomes.  Doing this quickly develops into an impressive profile of resources that show that you are intentional about your professional development. 
													</br></br>
													The best part about this is that if you keep up with all of this, doing a little bit of work on it here and there, it naturally grows more and more with little effort from you at any given time.  Compare this technique to the amount of time and stress required if you tried to create a CV from scratch right before your first job app -- chaos.  <i>Putting in the time now and intentionally thinking about this will pay off, I promise.</i>
												</p>
												
												
												<p>
													<strong><font color="#589FCE">GITHUB</font></strong> &mdash; as the modern astronomer frequently moonlights as a computer scientist, online websites like GitHub (that can house software development and implement version control using Git) are fantastic resources to use and develop.  In job &amp; fellowship applications, cultivating your GitHub and linking it to your apps/CV/etc. is a great idea.  I'll specify a few ways I have personalized my GitHub, in case it helps you think through how to work on yours. Click on the button below to see this.

													<ul><ul class="alt"> <!-- mention how you can turn on private repo tracker -->
														<li></li>
														<li>
															<strong>Be intentional about your username.</strong>
															When you're making your GitHub for the first time or when you're thinking about how to revamp your account, think carefully about what you want your username to be.  Ideally, you should pick a name that is unique to you (also, in my opinion, preferably without a list of numbers at the end, ex: taylor2798) and easy enough to remember or spell.  
															</br></br>
															For example, if your name is available by all means take that, but try not to let your username be too many characters either.  When I made my account,  my name (in every variation) was taken already.  So I used the word "aibhleog" because it was already my grad school email and it's a Gaelic word that no one else would use.
															</br></br>
															One of the major advantages to picking a good username for GitHub is that you can host your website from GitHub, which ends up being [your-username].github.io -- so as you can see, being intentional with your username is a great idea.
														</li>
														<li>
															<strong>Add a GitHub bio to your GitHub Profile.</strong>
															This is a relatively new feature (c. 2020, I think) that allows you to create a README that appears on your profile, kind of like a bio.  It's super easy to set up and there are lots of great examples on how to customize it to be exactly like you want.  Also -- along the same lines as before -- this is a GREAT way to build up that professional overall profile that I mentioned before.
															</br></br>
															Below are some links that can help you get more familiar with how to make and customize your own.
															</br></br>
															<ul class="actions fit small">
																<li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme" class="button primary small fit" target="_blank">GitHub info page</a></li>

															</ul>
														</li>		
														<li>
															<strong>Commit often.</strong>  Not only is this a good idea in general, because this is where the power of version-controlled coding comes in, but it also boosts your activity bar on your GitHub profile.  Which is a good idea because it shows consistency in work and developement.
														</li>
														<li>
															<strong>Pinning certain repositories to your profile.</strong> Another great way to cultivate your GitHub profile is to pin specific repositories to it, in order to highlight them.  You can select up to six repositories to pin, which can include your own repos and/or ones that you've forked.
														</li>				
														<li>
															<strong>Having more than one repository.</strong>  This may seem obvious, but having more than one reposity on your GitHub helps to show that you've 1) taken the time to use GitHub, and 2) shows that you're cultivating a few different projects.  These repositories could be anything.  If you're comfortable having the code you write for research version-controlled via a public GitHub repo, that's an excellent example of a repository to have on your profile -- with the added bonus that it's one that you'll be very active in!
															</br></br>
															As for other repositories, I recommend having 1-3 others as well, to flesh out your GitHub profile.  For myself, I love to dabble in different small projects that allow me to explore something I'm curious out and/or learn a new coding package or technique that I otherwise wouldn't use in my own research.  You can check out some of the little GitHub projects I have linked below, as well as some ideas for various kinds of coding projects you could dabble in if you're interested.
															</br></br>
															<ul class="actions fit small">
																<li><a href="https://aibhleog.github.io/github.html" class="button primary small fit" style="background-color:#CD5C5C; color:#fff" target="_blank">my GitHub projects</a></li>

																<li><a href="https://github.com/The-Cool-Coders/Project-Ideas-And-Resources" class="button primary small fit" target="_blank">other project ideas</a></li>
															</ul>
															
															I also host this website off of my GitHub, so that another very active repo.  Additionally, you can fork other people's repositories and there have your own copies linked to your GitHub as well.
															</br></br>
															HOWEVER, none of this is required.  You could also do something as simple as making a repository to store code you've used for certain plots, a repository for a script you've written to automate something or a productivity tool, etc.

												<!-- WEBSITES --> 
												<p>
													<strong><font color="#589FCE">PERSONAL WEBSITE</font></strong> &mdash; as any fellow grad student in my graduate program could tell you, an agenda that I push hard is that every academic should have a personal website.  Even if it's just an online platform for your publication list and CV/resume, having an online presence is a good idea.  I've had a lot of opportunities come from people looking at my website and then reaching out -- it also helps that I link my website to all of my social medias.
													</br></br>
													I understand that for some, having an online presence like that isn't ideal or wanted -- however I would gently push back on that to point out that, as professional scientists, it's a good idea to be google-able for jobs and other opportunities.  If someone can google your name and field (e.g., "Taylor Hutchison astronomy") and have your website be one of the first things that pops up, that's a good thing and shows that you're intentional about cultivating your professional profile.
													</br></br>
													At some point I plan to write a post on my website all about making websites, styling advice, and the different ways to go about doing this... but for now, below I'll link a few websites that are great for either finding an HTML template to modify yourself or for editing existing templates online via an graphical editor.

													<!-- personal ads -->
													<strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; MAKE A PERSONAL ADS LIBRARY</font></strong> &mdash; This was some great advice I got from my friend <a href='https://emily-c-martin.com' target='_blank'>Dr. Emily Martin</a>.  By making a personal ADS library with every paper you have led or been a co-author on, you can link this on your CV, website, etc.  Also, you can export your citations to a table of authors and affiliations (helpful when a job asks for a publication list). 
													<!-- button -->
													</br></br><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/JwoiXzYoSdikDW8g9haG2g" class="button primary" target="_blank">my public ads library</a>
													<dl><dd>How to do this:  </br>
													First, make a personal ADS library on your ADS account, name the library with your name &ndash; for example, mine is <strong>Taylor A. Hutchison</strong>.  Make sure that the library is public -- you can do this by navigating to the "Manage Access" tab on the library.   Finally, take the "public address" link they provide for the library (NOT your URL) and use that wherever you want to link your library.</dd></dl>
												</p>
													
												<!-- link orcid to ads -->
												<p><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; Link your ORCID to your ADS</font></strong>, then you can add your papers to your ORCID through an official channel.  Additionally, be sure to update your employment and your education on your ORCID profile, as well as adding keywords and linking your website and your GitHub.</p>
													
												<!-- exporting ads -->
												<p><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; EXPORTING CITATIONS VIA ADS</font></strong>, using custom formatting.  Let's pretend that you've made an ADS library for your NSF AAPF application.  You want to export all of your citations at once, but the NSF requires that every single author on every single paper is listed (silly, yes I know).  With ADS, you can do this in seconds! 
												<ol><ol>
													<li>Check the boxes next to the citations you want to export (or check the box that marks all of them). </li>
													<li>Click to the tab in the library that says "Export", it should drop down a list of options (like BibTex, AASTex, etc).  </li>
													<li>Click on "Other Formats", which will take you to a new page with a drop down box.  </li>
													<li>Click on the box and choose the last entry ("custom format").  A blank box should appear below the drop down box.</li>
													<li>In this empty box, copy and paste the first line of the code I share below (don't include the "// NSF AAPF" part) into that entry box and press "Apply.</li>
												</ol></ol>
<pre><code>// NSF AAPF
%l (%Y), %J, %V, %p.\n 

// NPP (separate bib)
%3.2a (%Y), %T, %J, %V, %p.\n

// NPP (in statement)
%3.1m (%Y), %j, %V, %p $\bullet$</pre></code>

													Congrats!  You have a complete list of all of your references in the correct format, with every single author on every single paper listed.  You can now export this list by copy and pasting into a document, or by clicking "Download to File".  </br></br>
													For completeness, I also listed examples for what I used for my NPP application, too.  You should also check out ADS's help page for this feature (<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/actions/export" target="_blank">linked here</a>) and explore all of your options.  ALSO BE SURE TO CHECK THE SOLICIATION REQUIREMENTS FOR YOUR JOB APPS WHEN EXPORTING CITATIONS.

												<!-- adding pdfs in latex -->
												<p><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; Adding PDFs together via LaTeX.</font></strong> Sometimes jobs will require that you put your research statement, cover letter, and CV all in one PDF.  If this happens, you can either add them together using a PDF editor or you can do the following in LaTeX (in this example, we're adding our CV to the document).  Thanks to my friend & colleague <a href="https://tx.ag/joncohn" target="_blank">Dr. Jonathan Cohn</a> for sharing this neat trick!

														<p><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; JOB TRACKER SPREADSHEET.</font></strong> Early on into the job cycle, I was looking through the jobs and fellowship that had already posted, marking the ones I was interested in, wondering how I would keep track of everything.  Serendipitously, at that moment my friend Dr. Jackie Champagne shared this amazingly detailed spreadsheet that she had made to track all of the fellowships that were in our field.  Taking that spreadsheet, I modified it to work for both postdoc jobs and fellowships and used it as my centralized job tracker.</p>
														<p>I've made a template version of my spreadsheet job tracker, which is linked below.  In the spreadsheet, there are three tabs so you can see how the document changes as you apply for things and begin hearing back from places.  Also, I've added a lot of comments with additional information, so hover over the cells with the gold corners to see what comments I've left.
														Feel free to make a copy of this document and modify it however you want so that it can best fit your job app needs!</p>

													<li>
															<p><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; RESEARCH STATEMENT/PROPOSAL.</font></strong>  Similar to how I set up my cover letters, most of my research statements were generated in the same Overleaf template (the only ones that weren't in this file were the fellowships that had their own templates).  Every time I started a new app, I made a new <strong>.tex</strong> file, copy-pasting a general statement in there and modifying it to fit the specific job better.  Then, I comment out everything else in the <strong>main.tex</strong> file and input that particular job's new <strong>.tex</strong> file.
															</br></br>
															Check out the template below to see what I mean!

													<li>
														<p><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; COVER LETTERS.</font></strong> When writing my cover letter, I looked through a variety of templates until I decided to stick with a more simplified one that I modified (because I can easily hyperfocus on styling and that wasn't what I needed to focus on). Very similar to the document I share in the Research Statement/Proposal section above, I structured my cover letter to where I could comment in and out the letters for various institutions while preserving the general formatting.</p>
														<p>To see what I mean, check out the first button below.  I also include in this template the general way that I structured my letters (introducing myself, highlighting my experience, summarizing proposed work, etc.).  You are welcome to use all or none of this advice in your own cover letters -- if you just want to use the template format but not the content, that's totally fine. </p>
														<p>Also linked below are all of the varous cover letter templates offered by Overleaf, the online LaTeX editor.  Check them out and find one that works for you!  I do recommend that, regardless of the template you use, you set your document up like my example, where you can comment in and out various <strong>.tex</strong>.  It'll save you a lot of time and headaches.  </p>

															<p><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; Asking past/current fellows for their apps.</font></strong> When applying for fellowships, it's a great idea to ask current and/or past fellows if they are comfortable sharing their applications that they submitted for the fellowship.  Seeing successful examples of a fellowship application can be really helpful when crafting your own.  I sent a ton of emails like this at the beginning of the job cycle.</p>
															<p>Sometimes, I was just asking if they'd be comfortable sharing their app; other times, I asked if they'd have time to meet and talk about what it's like to be a fellow and how they accomplished the things they proposed for.  The latter was especially something I was interested in for fellowships like the NSF AAPF, where they have you propose for not only your science but also a "broader impacts" program.</p>
															<p>I'm eternally grateful to every person who replied and shared their application materials with me.  In the same spirit, I've generalized my emails that I sent and turned them into templates which you are welcome to use if you find them helpful!  You can find the email templates linked below:</p>

														<p><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; LETTER OF REC TRACKER.</font></strong> For each of my letter writers, I created a Google Sheets tracker for each job that I was applying for.  This tracker is a heavily modified version of one shared with me by a postdoc friend (& mentor) of mine, <a href="stephaniehho.com" target="_blank">Dr. Stephanie Ho</a>.  In this tracker, I included details such as the job/fellowship name, link to the job ad, who to address the letters to, when the deadlines were, and a checkbox for the letter writer to mark once they submitted a letter.  This helped both of us make sure that we were always on the same page.

														Because I had three letter writers, I made one version of this tracker then made two additional copies, so that <strong>each letter writer had their own spreadsheet.</strong>  Update the name of each file to reflect the last name of each letter writer.
																
														</br></br>
														Also, I've added a lot of comments with additional information, so hover over the cells with the gold corners to see what comments I've left.  Feel free to make a copy of this document and modify it however you want so that it can best fit you and your letter writers' needs!

													<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; EMAILING LETTER WRITERS.</font></strong> Once I had chosen my letter writers and confirmed that they were willing and comfortable writing me letters of recommendation, I sent out official emails to each of them.  In these emails, I highlighted the information they would need, including linking their specfic LoR tracking spreadsheets (see point above) and attaching my CV and any job app draft I had.
														</br></br>
														You can see a template of one of the emails I sent to a letter writer, with any identifying information redacted.

													</li></br>
													
													<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; Providing info to your letter writers.</font></strong> This is an incredibly helpful resource I encountered from a colleague (& mentor) of mine, Dr. Steven Finkelstein.  This is a Google Form that he sends to people who ask him to write a letter of recommendation.  In this form, he asks for general information about the job/opportunity they're applying for, a description (from the perspective of the applicant) of the academic relationship that he has with them, specific things that they may want him to focus on in his letter, etc.  
													</br></br>
													With his permission, I've pasted the questions from his form into a template document.  Feel free to make a copy of this document and fill it out for each of your letter writers, to aid them in crafting the perfect letters for you!

													</li></br>
													
													<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; Storing all submitted apps.</font></strong> This was something that one of my letter writers asked for, which turned out to be super useful.  Essentially, create a Google Drive folder or a Dropbox folder (whatever online storage service you use) and every time you apply for a new job, create a subfolder in there and put all of your application materials into it.  Keep doing this for every job app, so that your letter writers can reference it if they need to, when crafting their letters.
													</br></br>
													This also saves your letter writers from having to dig through emails for your statements, and keeps everything organized.  I'd also recommend that when you send out reminder emails about upcoming job deadlines (see next point) you re-link this "submitted apps" folder every time for them.
													</li></br>
														
													<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">&mdash; Emailing reminders of upcoming deadlines.</font></strong> As a courtesy to your letter writers, it's a good idea to send reminder emails for upcoming deadlines.  In the end, I would email them every other week with deadlines for the upcoming two weeks.  But also, feel free to ask your letter writers beforehand if they want these reminders or not. 
													</br></br>
													If it helps, I've included some email templates for sending email reminders to your letter writers:

													In this section, I'll just be listing tips and advice that I got from various sources on how to prepare for job interviews, both general advice and then academic advice specifically.
												</p>

												<h3>general job interviews tips</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
												<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">In preparing for interviews</font></strong> &mdash; Look up common interview questions, prepare for them and practice what you would say. You can think through/practice these alone, or do this with a colleague. </li>
												<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">Be honest, but spin it positive</font></strong> &mdash; This is advice I received from my colleague & friend (& mentor) Dr. Jasleen Matharu. Be honest about what you don't know, but make sure that's not all you talk about.  There are ways to frame the areas you're less familiar with which can show the interviewer that, yes, you may not know this thing/technique, but you have the drive and interest in developing this skill. </li>
												<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">Sell the idea of you</font></strong> &mdash; Interviews are opportunities to share your skillsets, your experience, and things that you don't know but express that you're willing or excited to learn.  Even better if the job you're applying to allows you the opportunity to develop these skills with experts.  It may feel uncomfortable to talk yourself up so much, but these moments are when that's the best thing to do.  Don't go over the top, but also don't downplay your skillsets, strengths, and interests.</li>
												<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">Familiarize yourself with the institution</font></strong> &mdash; What does the place you're interviewing at seem to value?  Do their values align with your own?  Look through their website to get a gauge of this.  Look at the people who work there -- are these people you can collaborate with? What kind of science are they doing, and how might you be able to contribute to it? </li>
												</ul>
												

												<h3>more academic-specific interview tips:</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
												<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">Prepare a list of questions</font></strong> &mdash; This is some advice that I got from a senior postdoc colleague of mine, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/astro-ynzhang/home?authuser=0" target="_blank">Dr. Yuanyuan Zhang</a>, which is to prepare a list of questions that contain both "harmless filler" ones and "serious" or more science-career-focused questions. This is useful not only to show that you prepared for the interview (and that you're serious about the position), but it can also fill in any awkward moments you may have.
												</br>
												Some questions could be like the following:
												</br></br>
												<ul><ul>
													<li>What kind of computing resources does your institution have?</li>
													<li>What kind of telescope access does your institution have?</li>
													<li>Can postdocs PI observing proposals?</li>
													<li>What's the institution/company culture?</li>
													<li>What would I be working on as part of your group?</li>
													<li>How can I contribute to your broader scientific goals?</li>
													<li>Do you enjoy living in [city/town/area]?</li>
													<li>What do you and your colleagues do for fun in [city/town/area]?</li>
													<li>[other questions?]</li>
												</ul></ul>
												</li>

												<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">Look up your interviewer(s)</font></strong> &mdash; If you know who will be interviewing you, it can be helpful to look up their research profiles -- but don’t overdo it.  If it's relevant to the conversation, you can mention collaborations they're a part of, work that they've published, science they've done, etc.  When done right, it can show that you did the work to prepare for the interview and that you're serious about not only the position, but also working with these people as colleagues. </li>

												<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">Understand the format of the interview</font></strong> &mdash; An important piece of advice from my colleague & friend <a href="https://ahriley.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Alex Riley</a> is to make sure you understand the format of the interview going in.  This can include things like who will be interviewing you, should you prepare slides (if so, how long are you speaking for) or just have a quick spiel prepared about your future research, etc.  These are all very reasonable things to ask beforehand.</li>
												</ul>



												<h3>from hiring perspective</h3>
												<ul class="alt">
												<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">What the interviewer looks for</font></strong> &mdash; Below are some things that the hiring party may be looking for. This list comes from my brother Jason Schulke, who has been on industry hiring committees, but the same ideas can apply to academic jobs.
												</br></br>
												<ul><ul>
													<li>Curiousity is something to look for.</li>
													<li>Are you thoughtful about the position?</li>
													<li>Are you excited by the purpose of the organization?</li>
													<li>Does it tie to your career goals?</li>
													<li>Candidates that ask good questions stand out.</li>
													<li>Are you process-oriented? (depends upon job needs, of course)</li>
													<li>Do you have humility?  Confidence is important too, of course -- but this question comes from the fact that you're not working in isolation.</li>
													<li>Would you work well in a collaborative environment?</li>
													<li>"Bias for action": Are you able to make informed decisions and follow through on them with confidence?</li>
												</ul></ul>

												Below are some random tips/tricks that I used during the job cycle that didn't fit in the other sections of this guide.
											</p>
											
												<!-- organizational tips -->
												<h3>organizational tips</h3>
												<p><strong><font color="#EBA28A">make a new CSS class so the sizes are custom at large screen sizes and fit for small screen sizes</font></strong></p>
												
												<ul class="alt">
													<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">Labeling outgoing emails</font></strong> &mdash; I was super excited when I discovered this feature in Gmail.  If you and/or your institution uses Gmail, you can label outgoing emails.  For example, all of the job-related emails I had were assigned a "Jobs" label.  Because of this feature, I could also apply this "Jobs" label to my outgoing emails (like to my letter writers, to job postings when asking questions, etc).

														</br></br>
														<span class="image fit"><img src="images/job-cycle/label-outgoing-emails.png" alt="" /></span> 
													</li>

													<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">Useful Google Calendar trick</font></strong> &mdash; In google calendar, when creating a new event by clicking on the date, you can do a fun trick. When you're typing out the title of the event, if you add the time as well, it autopopulates the time section.  For example, "mentally prepare for launch 10AM" becomes "mentally prepare for launch" set at 10am once you press ENTER.
														</br></br>
														(yes that example was JWST related and yes I made that before they delayed it 3 more days lol)
														</br></br>
														<span class="image fit"><img src="images/job-cycle/gcal-example.png" alt="" /></span> 
													
													</li>
													
													<!--li> consider adding a thing about organizing your calender using sub-calendars?</li-->
													
													<li><strong><font color="#589FCE">Creating email filters</font></strong> &mdash; This is just a general email housekeeping tip, but creating email filters for specific email addresses or keywords can be helpful during the chaotic job cycle.  For example, you can set up a filter for the keyword "jwst" that can auto-label emails the "Jobs" label (see below for another Gmail example). Now, obviously maybe don't do this for that keyword, as lots of random emails could have that word in it, but you get the idea.
													</br></br>   
													Just something to consider!
													</br></br>

												<h3>motivational tips</h3>
													</p><strong><font color="#589FCE">Having a TO-DONE list</font></strong> &mdash; This is something I did that really helped with my mental health and motivation throughout the job cycle.  Essentially, in addition to the various TO-DO lists I had scattered around on random post-it notes (I'm a chaotic kind of "organized"), I made something I called a TO-DONE list.  In my TO-DONE list, I wrote and crossed out things that I was doing for my various job apps -- even if they were small things, I added them!  It all builds up, and helped remind me of how much I was really doing which helped with my overall motivation for the job cycle.
													</br></br>
													Here's my TO-DONE list.  I use Trello for a variety of things, but I especially love it because I have this "card" and I just keep adding to the check list and then immediately check the items off -- it's super sastifying and very encouraging.
